// This is intended to be an abstract base class, but provides a simple default implementation
// for testing purposes. This class reperesents a file, the contents of which are to be held in a
// buffer and modified, until the time comes to `.sync()` the contents to the file system and free
// said buffer to save memory. This is how we implement write caching: we have lots of these and
// `.sync()` them as rarely as we can.
//
// The default implementation buffers the entire contents of a file in the file system, but only
// does so when the first read/write request is made, as a form of lazy initialisation. It writes
// the entire contents back to the original file when `.sync()` is called.
//
// NOTE: Neither `CachedFile`, nor the classes that derive from it, call `.sync()` in their
// destructors as you might expect. This is because `.sync()` might throw exceptions, in which case
// Very Bad Thingsâ„¢ will happen.
