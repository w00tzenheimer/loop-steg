// This class is a specialisation of `CachedFile`. It's intended to act as a 'manager' for
// loop-steg, which behaves like a `CachedFile` in that it buffers file contents to memory and
// flushes them with `.sync()`, but actually has multiple `StegFile`s behind the scenes, and
// provides an interface as if they are one big file. It also handles the complicated business of
// reading/writing randomly across all the files, So You Don't Have Toâ„¢.
